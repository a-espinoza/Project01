I build this game from the ground with the help and inspiration of different other Hangman games online.
The technologies used in this game are HTML5, CSS3, and javaScript.

Stories:
As a user, I should be able to open the game and start playing right away.
I should also be able to do the following:
Know how many letters are in the word that im trying to guess.
Know how many tries I have initially, and how many I have left after each time I miss a letter.
I shoul be able to start a new game after loosing. - Also after winning!
